This project is a simple implementation of a data transfer system between two lists using TypeScript and React. The project allows users to move items between the two lists using buttons to transfer all or selected items from one list to the other.

## Features âœ¨

 Two lists (left and right) displayed side by side.
- **>>**: Transfers all items from the left list to the right list.
- **>**: Transfers selected items from the left list to the right list.
- **<**:  Transfers selected items from the right list to the left list.
- **<<**: Transfers all items from the right list to the left list.
- The > and < buttons are disabled when no items are selected.
